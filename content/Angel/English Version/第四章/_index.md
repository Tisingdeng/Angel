### Chapter 4  Is Angel Investing for You？
### 第四章 天使在为你投资吗？

#### Money, Time, Network, and Expertise

#### 金钱、时间、网络和专业技能
In order to be an effective angel investor, you need some combination of money, time, network, and expertise.

为了成为一个有效的天使投资者，你需要具备一些金钱、时间、网络和专业知识的组合。

You don’t have to have all of them, mind you. I’ve met trust fund kids with no experience, other than being in the lucky sperm club, who jump into angel investing in their twenties by writing a ton of checks at incubator demo days.

请注意，你不一定非得拥有所有这些。我遇到过没有经验的信托基金的孩子，除了在幸运的精子俱乐部里，他们在20多岁的时候跳进天使投资的坑，在孵化器的演示日上写了大量的支票。

I know folks who were broke and busy but had huge networks and tons of knowledge, who weaseled their way onto cap tables by being advisors.

我认识一些人，他们身无分文、忙忙碌碌，但却拥有庞大的人脉网络和大量的知识，他们靠当顾问来绕道进入公司顶层。

In fact, before I had any money, I would trade my network and knowledge of how to promote startups for equity.

事实上，在我有钱之前，我会用人脉和知识来换取更多在创业公司的股权。

Twice it actually resulted in checks: sixteen dimes ($16,000) from an advisor position I had with a social network startup that failed its way into an acquihire (acquired specifically to hire its talent) and 150 dimes from a coupon and deals company that had me on its board.

它让我获得了两次收益：16个一角（16000美元）来自我在一家社交网络创业公司的顾问职位，他们之前未能成功进入一个（基金（专为聘用人才而收购）），还有150个硬币来自于一个有我参与董事会的证券和交易公司。

That’s $210,000 from just going to some board meetings, making introductions, and letting founders put my name on their website. Of course, you have to have some type of reputation and industry knowledge to make those kinds of deals work.

只参加一些董事会会议，做介绍，并让创始人在他们的网站上留下我的名字，这就是21万美元。当然，你必须要有一定的声誉和行业知识，才能使这类交易奏效。

There is a long-standing, and totally accepted, tradition of “advisors” getting 10 or 50 BPS—basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point—over two or three years, for helping a startup.

有一个长期的、完全被接受的“顾问”传统，即在两到三年的时间里获得10或50个BPS（基准点，或百分之一百分点），来帮助初创公司。

Many times, these advisors call themselves angels even though they don’t write checks. Real angel investors make fun of them, calling them “broke angels,” but the truth is I’ve seen many advisors provide more help to founders than their investors did—which makes sense since they got their shares for free!

很多时候，这些顾问自称为天使，即使他们不写支票。真正的天使投资者会取笑他们，称他们为“破产天使”，但事实是，我看到许多顾问为创始人提供的帮助比那些投资者提供的帮助更多——这也是有道理的，因为他们免费得到了他们的股票！

I’ll tell you more about advisors later. Let’s see if you have what it takes to be an angel.

我稍后会告诉你更多关于顾问的事情，让我们看看你是否有成为天使的能力。


#### Dealing with Wild Cards
#### 处理外卡问题
The best angels in the world have four qualities, giving them the ability to (1) write a check (money), (2) jam out with the founders over important issues (time), (3) provide meaningful customer and investor introductions (network), and (4) give actionable advice that saves the founders time and money—or keeps them from making mistakes (expertise).

世界上最好的天使有四种品质，它们有能力做以下的事情：
（1）开一张支票（提供资金）
（2）帮助创始人们解决重要的问题（付出时间）
（在重要的问题（时间）上和创始人们挤在一起）
（3）提供有帮助的客户和投资者介绍（提供人脉网络）
（4）提供可操作的建议，以节省创始人的时间和金钱——或者避免他们犯错误（专业经验）

There is another quality that you’ll need to ensure you enjoy your time as an angel investor. You should enjoy having coffee with, and talking to, a range of different personalities—including the brilliant and calculating founders who will drive a few of your returns, as well as the delusional and difficult ones, who will be the majority of your returns.

作为一个天使投资者，你还需要享受天使投资人的生活。你应该享受和不同性格的人一起喝咖啡、聊天，包括那些聪明、精于算计的创始人——他们会给你一些回报，以及妄想的和执拗的创始人——他们将是你的大部分回报。

If you’re not able to get along with a wide range of people or find it uncomfortable to hear people drone on and on about how they’re going to change the world and everyone else just doesn’t get it, then this is absolutely not the job for you.

如果你不能与各种各样的人相处，或者听到人们喋喋不休地谈论他们将如何改变世界，（而其他人却不能做到），那么这绝对不是你能做的事情。

Agents who manage models and actors have to deal with the insecurities of people who constantly need to be the center of attention. Likewise, as an angel investor, you’ll have to deal with people who are passionately stubborn and insist that the world change to fit their unique vision.

代理人必须需处理模特和演员经常要成为关注焦点的不安全感。同样地，作为一个天使投资者，你必须和那些狂热地固执己见的人打交道，他们可能坚持要世界改变以适应他们独特的幻想。

Some folks call these people
visionaries, but that’s only after they’ve made a ton of money and launched products that people can’t live without. When you meet them, they’ll be just starting out and people will refer to them as assholes, narcissists, and nutjobs.

有些人把这些人称为空想主义者，但那是在他们赚了很多钱，并推出了人们不能没有的产品之后。当你遇到他们时，他们只是刚起步，人们会把他们称为混蛋、自恋者和疯子。

When someone tells me they have a founder they want to introduce me to but they’re worried because the person is a wild card, I set that meeting up for the next day. Angel investors are looking for wild cards, because the best founders are typically inflexible and unmanageable, pursuing their visions at the expense of other people’s feelings.

当有人告诉我他们有一个创始人，想把我介绍给他时，但他们担心我不愿意，因为这个人是个未知数，如此我还是为他安排了第二天的会议。天使投资者会寻找未知数，因为最优秀的创始人通常是顽固并难以驾驭的，以牺牲他人的感受为代价来追求他们的愿景。

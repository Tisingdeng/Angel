### Chapter 2 The Brooklyn Grinder
### 第二章   布鲁克林·格莱因德


#### Is Angel Investing Gambling?
#### 天使投资是赌博吗？
Folks in the technology industry debate if angel investing is gambling or actual investing, and it depends largely on how you approach it. Every year I place forty bets hoping to win back more in aggregate than I’ve put down.

科技界人士争论天使投资是赌博还是实际投资，在很大程度上取决于你如何对待它。每年我下注四十次，希望总数上赢利大于亏损。

I’ve invested just under $10 million in the six years I’ve been angel investing, and the portfolio I’ve built is worth over $150 million—that’s a return of fifteen times my investment.
在过去六年里，我在天使投资的投资总额不足一千万美元，而投资产值超过一亿五千万美元，回报是投资的十五倍。

That’s mind-blowing for a kid from Brooklyn who watched his parents fight, at least 90 percent of the time, over money.

这对一个来自布鲁克林区的孩子来说是一个很好的主意，因为他的父母大部分时间都在为了钱而吵架。

More mind-blowing, however, is that the majority of my investment dollars were invested in the past three years ($9 million of the $10 million, in fact).

更令人兴奋的是，大部分资金（也就是一千万中的九百万）都是在过去三年里投的。

If you drill down, I invested under $100,000 in the first year as an angel and hit my two big winners to date, Uber and Thumbtack, in my first five investments.

而且，我第一年在天使投资投了不到十万美元，并在我的前五次投资中遇到了迄今为止我的两个大赢家——Uber和Thumbtack。

The return multiple from the first two years of my investing is actually fifteen hundred times.

实际上，投资的头两年的回报倍数是十五倍。

These startups take ten years to play out, so no one knows exactly where I will sit in the “hall of fame” of angel investing—if one is ever built—but it is safe to say I’ll be in the top ten angel investors of all time.

这些创业公司需要十年的时间才能做出成绩，所以没有人知道我会不会坐进天使投资的“名人堂”——如果有“名人堂”——但可以肯定的是，我永远都会是天使投资的十大投资者之一。

I buy lottery tickets for a living, but unlike the normal schmucks on the street, I get to buy tickets that are in the top 1 percent of the winning pool.

我以买彩票为生，但我街上的笨蛋不一样，我只买获胜率在前百分之一的彩票。

If you have to match seven numbers to win with your lottery tickets, I have to match just two.

如果你匹配七个号码才能赢，我只匹配两个。

I’ve figured out, and will explain to you
in detail, how I’ve gamed the system. I’ve rigged the roulette table so it falls on my number ten times more often than yours.

我已经发现了其中的奥秘，以后会详细向你解释如何操作。 我操纵了这个轮盘赌桌，所以我赢的机率是你的十倍。

I’m starting every hand of poker with the ace of spades, so my chances of hitting pocket rockets are 1 in 17 while yours are 1 in 220.

我每次开场都有一手好牌（包括黑桃A），所以我赢的机会是十七分之一，而你的是二百二十分之一。

If you can’t tell already, I’m really excited with where I am in life. Sorry if I sound like an obnoxious narcissist who thinks he’s figured it all out—but I actually have. For years people asked me to write books and I kept telling my agent “one more win.”

无论你认同与否，我都认为我的生活精彩又刺激。如果我听起来像个讨厌的自恋者一样认为自己无所不知，那我道歉——但我真的找到了其中的奥秘。多年来，人们要求我写书，而我却不断地告诉我的经纪人“再赢一次”。


#### The Sequoia Scout Program’s Secret Origin
#### 红杉资本“侦察员”计划的秘密起源

Investing in the cab company that changed the world was that “one more win.” When the Wall Street Journal did a front-page story on my role as the first “Scout” for Sequoia Capital, the most famous venture capital firm in the world, everything was revealed.

投资于改变世界的出租车公司确实让我“又赢了一次”。华尔街日报头版刊登了关于我作为世界上最著名的风险投资公司——红杉资本——“侦察员”的文章，之后一切都真相大白。

Yep, the brilliant venture capitalists (VCs) who backed Apple, Google, Cisco, Yahoo!, YouTube, Airbnb, WhatsApp, and countless others had started an angel investing program called “Scouts,” and I was the first one selected.

确实，那些支持苹果、谷歌、思科、雅虎，YouTube、Airbnb、WhatsApp和其他公司的勇于冒险的资本家，开创了天使投资名为“侦察员”的投资计划，而我是第一个选择这个计划的人。

Scouts was a simple concept: Sequoia Capital would put up the money and twenty carefully selected founders of technology companies would pick founders they know to back.

侦察员的理念很简单：红杉资本负责融资，二十个精心挑选的科技公司创始人负责挑选其他作为投资对象的创始人。

The returns would be split: 45 percent to the Scout who made the investment, 50 percent to Sequoia, and 5 percent in a bonus pool to the other Scouts in the program.

回报将分为：百分之四十五归侦察员投资计划，百分之五十归红杉资本，百分之五用于侦察员分红。

This was the deal of the century for us Scouts, because venture capital firms like Sequoia actually only get 20 to 30 percent of the returns when they invest other people’s money.

这对我们侦察员来说是难得的大生意，因为像红杉这样的风投公司的实际收益只有百分之二十到三十。

My hunch is that they didn’t care what the split was because we were a bunch of nonprofessional investors and the chances of us hitting a home run—let alone a grand slam—were minute. For them, Scouts were a way to increase their visibility into the early-stage market.

我认为，他们根本不在乎回报如何，因为我们是一群非专业投资者，而且我们打出本垒打也是侥幸，更不用说大满贯了。所以对他们来说，侦察员是提高他们在进入市场早期时提高知名度的一种方式。

The kid from Brooklyn was anointed by the smartest cats in the business. My job was to find the next big thing. It was like George Steinbrenner calling me and saying, “How would you like to help the Yankees win another World Series?”

布鲁克林区的孩子被商业巨头选定为继承人。而我的工作是解决下一件大事，就像乔治·史坦布莱纳打电话问我：“你想怎么帮助美国职业棒球大联盟赢得下一个世界职业棒球大赛？”

Holy. Fucking. Shit. YES!

就是这样！

#### I Used to Dream About This Life
#### 我曾经梦想的生活

When I was a kid I always dreamed of having a dad who was a rich banker or billionaire, going to Harvard, and having a trust fund—as opposed to having a dad who almost went to jail.

小时候，我一直希望我的爸爸是一个有钱的银行家，或者亿万富翁，他上过哈佛，有一个信托基金，而不是一个进
了监狱的爸爸。

I’d dream of what it was like to be on the inside and have your college tuition paid for, your apartment in Manhattan gifted to you, and getting $100,000 to invest in a business if you lobbied your parents for fifteen minutes over Thanksgiving—like many of my friends had.

我一直梦想着这样的生活——有人给你付学费、送给你一栋在曼哈顿的公寓、在感恩节时求了你父母十五分钟就可以拿到十万投资款——我朋友那样的生活。

I didn’t have that privilege and it put a fire in my belly.

我没有这个特权，而且它在我心中燃起了一把火。

I would sit there on the B train heading home from Fordham at Lincoln Center at ten p.m. on my way home to a three-hundred-dollar-a-month attic apartment on Tenth Avenue, where the only place you could stand upright was about 20 percent of the space in the dead center of the hallway, and think to myself, “What would it be like to be rich?”

晚上十点，我从林肯中心的福特汉姆回家，坐在电车上，回到那个第十大道上三百美元一个月的阁楼公寓里，我唯一能站直的地方就是走廊——公寓百分之二十的空间。我问自己：富有的生活是怎样的？

What would it be like to have $100,000 on the ATM receipt instead of $100?

在自动取款机上有十万美元余额，而不是一百美元，会是什么样子呢？

What would it be like not to have to worry about money every day of your life? I was so broke that when I was in college I would go to Manhattan at night with two tokens and $2 in my pocket, knowing how to spend it perfectly to get maximum calories from the hot dog vendor by Central Park who charged only $0.50 for a knish instead of $0.75 like everyone else.

每一天都不必为钱发愁，这样的生活会是什么样子呢？我大学时如此落魄——我晚上会去曼哈顿，口袋里只有两张代金券和两美元，我知道中央公园热狗小贩的馅饼只要五毛钱，不像别的地方要七毛五，我一样可以填饱肚子。

I would buy a bagel for $0.50 on the way in, two knishes for lunch, and a third knish on the way home—unless I spent it on a Coca-Cola like an idiot so I could stay awake in class.

我会在路上买一个五毛钱的面包圈，吃两个犹太馅饼，这就是我的午饭。乳酪要在回家的路上吃——除非我买了可乐，保证我能在课堂上保持清醒。

When you’re broke and see rich people in Manhattan all around you, it makes you curious: “How did these people become rich?”

当你在曼哈顿身无分文，看到周围的有钱人时，你会好奇：“这些人是怎样致富的？”

#### “Pass On What You Have Learned.”—Yoda

#### “传递你学到的东西” ——尤达
So, I studied every system in order to find one that is the most efficient for capital creation, and I believe that it’s angel investing in technology. I’m going to tell you everything in the coming chapters because if just one or two hundred of you become angels, it will make an impact on society—plus we can invest together (more on this in chapter 11)!

所以，我研究了每一个系统，以找到一个最有效的资本创造，我相信这是在技术领域投资的天使投资。我将在接下来的章节为你详细解说，因为如果你们中即使只有一两百人成为天使投资者，也会对整个社会产生影响，而且我们可以共同投资（详情在第十一章）！

Heck, if just one person uses this book to back the next great founder who has a world-changing idea, we’ll have made an impact together.

哎呀，如果只有一个人用这本书来支持下一个伟大的创始人——一个会改变世界的的创始人——我们就会一起改变世界。

There’s an outside chance that twenty-five thousand of you might become angel investors, and if that happens, it would change everything.

你们之中有二万五千人有可能成为天使投资人，如果真是这样，这将改变世界。

The world has trillions of dollars sitting in bonds, cash, stocks, and real estate, which is all really “dead money.” It sits there and grows slowly and safely, taking no risk and not changing the world at all.

世界上有数万亿美元的债券、现金、股票和房地产，但这些都是“死钱”。它躺在那里，缓慢而安全地生长着，没有风险，也没有改变世界。

Wouldn’t it be more interesting if we put that money to work on crazy experiments like the next Tesla, Google, Uber, Cafe X, or SpaceX?

如果我们把这笔钱用于下一个信托、谷歌、Uber，Cafe X或SpaceX这样的疯狂实验，那岂不是更有趣？

I’m forty-five years old at the time I’m writing this and I plan on doing five more years of angel investing—I’m on a ten-year plan.

我写这篇文章的时候已经四十五岁了，我计划再做五年的天使投资——我有一个十年计划。

Another two hundred bets and I’m done—then it’s your turn.

我再赌两百次，我完成了 ——然后轮到你了。

By the time I’m done with my ten-year plan, I will have invested in 350 startups and my goal is to return $250 million on $25 million deployed—I’m exactly halfway there.

当我完成我的十年计划时，我将投资三百五十家创业公司，我的目标是以两千五百万美元的价格返还二点五亿美元——我正好已经完成了一半。

#### No Gamble, No Future
#### 没有赌博，没有未来

Now, gambling has a very negative connotation here in the West, but when I would spend all night playing poker in Los Angeles, with mostly old Asian men, I would frequently hear them say “No gamble, no future,” before pushing their chips into the pot, standing up, and rubbing their necks and heads furiously (a tic I soon acquired unconsciously).

如今在西方，赌博是一件很不好的事情，然而每次我在洛杉矶和亚洲人通宵打牌，我经常听到他们说“没有赌博，没有未来”。他们投入筹码，站起身来，焦躁地揉着脖子和脑袋（我很快就发现了这样的动作）。

It took me a couple of times to understand what these old men were saying, but I quickly started saying it myself, whether I was at the tables or not.

我后来才明白这些老外在说些什么，但是我很快就开始这样鞭策自己，无论我是否在赌。

No gamble, no future.

没有赌博，没有未来。

If you learn anything from this book, it’s that you must take risks as an angel investor and in life if you want at least the chance of an outsized outcome.

如果你从本书中学到了什么，那就是你必须承担起天使投资者的风险，至少在人生中你想要赢一次，就必须承担风险。

This does not mean you should be reckless; in fact, it means the opposite. I’ve studied and studied how people have built wealth as angel investors and I’ve focused on having an unfair advantage over them.

这并不意味着你应该鲁莽；恰恰相反。我钻研了人们是如何以天使投资者的身份创造财富的，而且我专注于他们不同的优势。

I’m going to reveal every unfair advantage I have developed in the coming chapters so that you can deploy your money intelligently, or perhaps just more intelligently than everyone else, which, if you’ve ever won at poker, you know is the key to success.

我在接下来的章节中会说明每一种不同的优势，这样你就可以有效利用你的钱，或者比其他人更聪明，如果你曾赢过扑克，你就知道这是成功的关键。

If you can’t tell who the sucker at the poker table is, it’s you, so find another table or figure out how to be better than each of the other players. This might take time, but everything worthwhile in this life takes time and effort.

如果你不知道谁在牌桌上容易上当，那就是你，所以换一张赌桌或者找出赢得其他人的方法。这可能需要时间，但值得花上一生的时间和精力。

#### For the Real Outsiders
#### 真正的门外汉
As much as I feel like I’m an outsider—a kid from Brooklyn who didn’t go to Stanford and was born into the bottom of the middle class—the truth is I’m a lot closer to an insider than most folks in America, let alone anyone born in the developing world.

尽管我觉得自己是一个外人——一个来自布鲁克林的孩子，没有上过斯坦福大学，而是出生在中产阶级的底层 ——事实上，我比其他大多数人更接近内幕，更不用说在发展中国家出生的人了。

Let’s face it, I was born a white male in New York City at exactly the right time. I owned a thousand-dollar computer with a four hundred baud modem at the age of thirteen, and I was able to pay my way through night school at a decent college based on the skills I learned using that computer. If I didn’t have that computer, I would have ended up becoming a police officer (true story).

面对现实吧，我是出生于纽约的男性白人。我十三岁那年就拥有了一台一千美元的计算机和四百波特的调制解调器，而且正是因为我会使用电脑，我能够在一所体面的大学里上夜校。如果我没有那台电脑，我最终会成为一名警察（真的是这样）。

Someone living in poverty in small-town America—without that IBM PCjr—certainly wouldn’t have had the head start I did. Those facts don’t even address the larger, more complex cultural issues around gender and race in our society that I haven’t had to face.

在美国的小镇里生活的人们普遍贫困——没有电脑——当然不会像我一样聪明。这些事实甚至没有涉及到社会中更大、更复杂的文化问题——性别和种族，当然我也没有必要去面对。

I wrote this book to give outsiders a playbook that could level the playing field just a little bit—even if I’m not smart enough to understand or help solve the deeper, more systemic problems myself.

我写这本书的目的是为外人提供一个可以平衡比赛的攻略手册——即使我不够聪明，无法理解或帮助大家解决更深入系统的问题。
